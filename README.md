##### A.
We picked 10,000I (where I stands for iterations) for 2^8 to 2^11, 1000I for 2^11 to 2^15, 200I for 2^16 to 2^19, then 20 for 2^19 to 2^24. We picked these iterations because as the size of objects increases, the dataset will get bigger, so finding the the mean time per coordinate requires less iterations.
